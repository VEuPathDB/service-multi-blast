  maxResults:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    description: |-
      Number of results to limit the search to.

      Clients sending this value must also send limiting fields such as
      `max_target_seqs`, `num_descriptions`, or `num_alignments`.

      The service will validate that the value of the limiting field(s)
      multiplied by the number of query sequences does not exceed this value.

      Assuming that the number of query seqs is represented as `Q` the
      validation is performed as `(Q * max_target_seqs) <= maxResults` or
      `(Q * max(num_descriptions, num_alignments)) <= maxResults`.

  maxResultSize:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    description: |-
      Maximum number of bytes the client is willing to accept for report
      results.  If a requested report for a job is greater in size than the
      job's `maxResultSize` value, the server will return a 403 error with a
      message indicating why it is refusing the report request.

      Additionally, when requesting a report, the client may choose to override
      this value by using the `Content-Max-Length` header to provide an
      alternative max file size.

      A value of `0` indicates no size limit for generated reports.
    default: 0

  maxSequences:
    type: integer
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 100
    default: 100
    description: |-
      Maximum number of sequences allowed.

      This will alter the service's validation to only allow the specified
      number of input sequences in the posted query.
