== The Stack

The Multi-Blast 2.0 service stack consists of 4 containers and 3 external
dependencies.

.Containers
1. The <<Query Service>>
2. The <<Report Service>>
3. A RabbitMQ message queue
4. A PostgreSQL database

.Dependencies
1. The VEuPathDB Oracle user database.
2. The VEuPathDB link:https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[BLAST+]
   databases.
3. An S3 instance with a bucket created for each of the Query Service and Report
Service.

== Query Service

The Query Service, built on the
link:{var-git-org-url}lib-compute-platform[Async Platform], exposes a REST API
through which API consumers may create, customize, and execute asynchronous
link:https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[BLAST+] query jobs against
VEuPathDB's BLAST+ databases.

[#lookup-query-job]
==== Lookup Job

. Look up job in user database
. Optionally link requesting user to the job in the user database
. Check the status of the job
. Return the job details


[#restart-query-job]
==== Restart Job

. Look up job in user database
. Verify user is linked to job
. Verify job is in the status "expired"
. Resubmit the job to the Async Platform

[#update-query-job]
==== Update Job

. Look up the target job in the user database
. Verify user is linked to the target job

=== Dependencies

. S3
. RabbitMQ
. PostgreSQL
. Oracle
. BLAST+ Databases


== Report Service

The Report Service, built on the
link:{var-git-org-url}lib-compute-platform[Async Platform], exposes a REST API
through which API consumers may generate custom reports from BLAST+ queries
executed using the <<Query Service>>.
